What is the priority intervention?", options: ["Administer 3% saline", "Restrict fluids to 800 mL/day", "Give furosemide", "Encourage oral fluids"], correctAnswer: 1, rationale: "SIADH causes water retention and hyponatremia. Fluid restriction is first-line to correct dilutional hyponatremia." },
      { id: 147, difficulty: 1, question: "Which medication is used to reverse opioid overdose?", options: ["Flumazenil", "Naloxone", "Atropine", "Physostigmine"], correctAnswer: 1, rationale: "Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that rapidly reverses respiratory depression and sedation in opioid overdose." },
      { id: 148, difficulty: 2, question: "A client with rheumatoid arthritis takes methotrexate. Which instruction is essential?", options: ["Take on an empty stomach", "Avoid sun exposure", "Take folic acid daily", "Double dose if a dose is missed"], correctAnswer: 2, rationale: "Folic acid supplementation reduces methotrexate side effects (e.g., stomatitis, hepatotoxicity) without reducing efficacy." },

Which finding indicates toxicity?", options: ["Patellar reflex 2+", "Urinary output 30 mL/hr", "Respirations 10/min", "BP 140/90 mmHg"], correctAnswer: 2, rationale: "Respiratory depression (<12 breaths/min) is a sign of magnesium toxicity. Loss of deep tendon reflexes is an earlier sign." }
